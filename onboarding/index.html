    <title> Hi!  This is a very rough draft of a lab onboarding page! </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    
    <h1> Let's ring in 2020 by documenting our onboarding guidelines! </h1>

    <p>
    This is a change made on July 6th, 2020.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since good artists copy and great artists steal, I propose we copy some 
    great arti^H^H^H^Hscientists and steal their stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>
      Todo: put this into Jekyll, markdown, or anything that avoids mighty vim!
    </em>
    </p>

    <h1> PROBLEM BASED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY! </h1>
    <p> 
    First things first, if you're doing dry work, you'll need a GitHub ID.
      <ol>
        <li>
          set up a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account, 
          if you don't already have one
        </li>
        <li>
          join the <a href="https://github.com/trichelab/">trichelab</a>
          organization on GitHub
        </li>
        <li>
          Fork the repository trichelab.github.io (these pages) to your account,
          edit it (I don't care what you edit, just do something useful), 
          `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and open a pull request against 
          the parent (trichelab) repository to merge the changes (or not). 
        </li>
        <li>
          Find someone to code review the merge.  Congratulations, you're a 10x 
          dry lab developer!  (or not... but at least you passed 'hello world') 
        </li>
      </ol>
      Notes: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Please don't get us sued if you can help it. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Feel free to migrate this dumpster fire to Jekyll or something pretty.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    Some theftworthy lab onboarding pages:
    <br />
    <a href="https://github.com/greenelab/onboarding/blob/master/onboarding.md">
      Casey Greene's Lab
    </a>
    <br />
    <a href="https://fertiglab.com/">Elana's lab</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    What all else can we drag in?  Surely there's rather a lot.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <em> What kind of computer/OS should I use for dry lab stuff? </em>
    That all depends -- if you're going to build R packages, just use Linux.
    <br />
    The Linux Subsystem for Windows version 2 (LS2) can be enabled on Windows.
    <br />
    If you're a normal human being, you can use Mac OS X, but it'll be rough if
    you later decide to maintain a Bioconductor package (looks good on your CV):
    <br />
    <blockquote>
      The lack of Mac binary packages for R-devel on CRAN together with the
      high turnover of Mac OS versions are a major PITA and the reason why
      when R/Bioconductor newbies ask me what OS I recommend for package
      development I always say Linux, without hesitation. Unless they want to
      suffer ;-)
    </blockquote>
    <br />
    <em>
      <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2020-January/016010.html">--Herve Pages</a>
    </em>
    <br />

    Whatever you use, put a lot of RAM in it, and execute your long-running 
    jobs on HPC or AWS so that you don't lock up your own machine and miss 
    deadlines, panic, etc.  Local machines are for exploration and development, 
    ONLY, and if you don't have multiple copies/backups of code/data/documents
    (ideally version controlled), it must not be very important.  

    <br />

    The best way I know of to ensure that code, experiments, and manuscripts 
    (work products) are durable and reproducible is to automate them, and then 
    set up continuous integration (for code products) so their reproducibility 
    is either continually verified or an alert raised. We did this for Arkas, 
    Bioconductor does it for packages, Casey does it for analyses, and Travis 
    or GitHub Actions can do it for your code/analyses. Get used to it; it
    sucks to set up but it's a lot better than trying to recreate everything 
    from scratch when a reviewer squawks 18 months from now.
