Set up a GitHub account, if you don't already have one

<p>If you are new to GitHub create an account <a href="https://github.com/join">here</a></p>

<p>Once/if you have an account, join the <a href="https://github.com/trichelab/">Triche Lab organization</a> on GitHub</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Fork the repository trichelab.github.io (these pages) to your account, 
you can do this by opening a repository and clicking on the "Fork" tab
on the right hand side of the page, this will allow you to access and 
edit a repository (I don't care what you edit, just do something useful), 
`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and open a pull request against 
the parent (trichelab) repository to merge the changes (or not). 

Find someone to code review the merge.  Congratulations, you're a 10x 
dry lab developer!  (or not... but at least you passed 'hello world')

What all else can we drag in?  Surely there's rather a lot.

What kind of computer/OS should I use for dry lab stuff?

That all depends -- if you're going to build R packages, just use Linux.
   
The Linux Subsystem for Windows version 2 (LS2) can be enabled on Windows.
 
If you're a normal human being, you can use Mac OS X, but it'll be rough if
you later decide to maintain a Bioconductor package (looks good on your CV):

<blockquote>

  <p>The lack of Mac binary packages for R-devel on CRAN together with the
high turnover of Mac OS versions are a major PITA and the reason why
when R/Bioconductor newbies ask me what OS I recommend for package
development I always say Linux, without hesitation. Unless they want to
suffer ;-)</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Whatever you use, put a lot of RAM in it, and execute your long-running 
jobs on HPC or AWS so that you don't lock up your own machine and miss 
deadlines, panic, etc.  Local machines are for exploration and development, 
ONLY, and if you don't have multiple copies/backups of code/data/documents
(ideally version controlled), it must not be very important.  

The best way I know of to ensure that code, experiments, and manuscripts 
(work products) are durable and reproducible is to automate them, and then 
set up continuous integration (for code products) so their reproducibility 
is either continually verified or an alert raised. We did this for Arkas, 
Bioconductor does it for packages, Casey does it for analyses, and Travis 
or GitHub Actions can do it for your code/analyses. Get used to it; it
sucks to set up but it's a lot better than trying to recreate everything 
from scratch when a reviewer squawks 18 months from now.
